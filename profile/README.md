### Team Vision

Data Science is a vast topic and so are there a vast range of projects that one can find in this domain. Projects not only mean mere notebooks or graphs but alongwith those, complete deployable models that can be deployed in GCP, MS Azure or AWS. DataMinati wants to establish a New Data Order working on thousands of projects, following multiple approaches, multiple tool integrations of persons from multiple backgrounds. Integrations of the soul of Data Minati, i.e. Data with web applications, federated learning, application integrations and APIs is widely encouraged. Also, as per the norms of our standard license, export of data, kernels etc are allowed and encouraged. Contribution of multiple enthusiasts on a project at a time and also a single person contributing to multiple projects at the same time is allowed. The only thing that is not allowed in this organization is the use of derogatory remarks about it or spamming other's works or copying without forking. If such cases of forgery are noticed or reported and a roven plagarsim is established, then the member stands at a risk of permanant denial of membership from the group. Aprt form theat, we will do everything possible to encourage our soldiers in the data war by awarding them with medals, swords and upliftment of ranks to boost their morale and make them more competitive. So, get ready for being DEVILIC...
